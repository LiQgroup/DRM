Description: This package contains two functions that are used to calculate
    p-values in the distance-based regression model, including drm.pf (the pseudo 
    F test statistic) and fast.pf (the standardized numerator of the pseudo F test 
    statistic, calculated using the asymptotic distribution or permutation procedures). 
    This package also contains a function which can transform a distance matrix 
    to a similarity matrix.
