Description: This package contains two functions that are used to calculate
    p-values in the distance regression model, including drm.pf (pseudo F test
    statistic) and fast.pf (standard error difference, calculated using asymptotic
    distribution or permutation procedure). This package also contains a function 
    which can transform a distance matrix to a similarity matrix.
